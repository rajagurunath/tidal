# Sell your idle tokens at half price: a Batch API for your own vLLM

Your GPU is bored. Not idle in the way `nvidia-smi` shows — utilization might read 60% — but bored in a more specific way: every scheduler iteration of your vLLM server can process a few thousand tokens, and when it's decoding chat responses for twenty users, it processes about twenty. The weights get streamed from HBM either way. The other ~99% of each iteration's token budget evaporates, every ten milliseconds, all day.

OpenAI and Anthropic figured out how to sell that evaporation. It's called the Batch API: upload a file of requests, get results within 24 hours, pay half price. The discount works because batch tokens are produced in the shadow of online traffic, on capacity that would otherwise be wasted. If you self-host, you can't buy this product and you can't sell it either — vLLM has no `/v1/batches`, and the offline batch runner it does ship wants the whole machine to itself.

Tidal fixes that. It's an open-source system that gives your vLLM deployment the same two products the commercial providers have: online inference at full price and full priority, and a durable, OpenAI-wire-compatible batch tier at half price with a 24-hour completion contract — admission that refuses infeasible jobs, and escalation that spends online headroom only when a deadline demands it — on the same GPU, at the same time.

## The part that isn't obvious: the guarantee

Co-locating batch behind online traffic is a known trick. Research systems (HyGen, ConServe) do it with strict priority: online requests always schedule first, batch fills the leftovers, and under memory pressure batch gets preempted. vLLM's own priority scheduling gives you the mechanism out of the box.

What nobody gives you is the *deadline*. In every existing co-location system, batch work is best-effort: if online traffic stays high, your overnight batch is simply not done in the morning, and nothing in the system ever noticed it drifting. That's fine for a research throughput graph. It's fatal for a product — the entire reason a customer uses a batch API is that "done by morning" is dependable enough to plan around.

Tidal's answer is a sixty-year-old idea from real-time scheduling: **laxity**. For every batch job, once a second:

```
laxity  = time_remaining − work_remaining / observed_rate
urgency = clamp(1 − laxity / 6h, 0, 1)      # ramps only in the last 6h of slack
priority = 100 → 1 as urgency goes 0 → 1    # online is 0; batch never displaces it
```

A batch that's on track has hours of laxity, urgency zero, priority 100 — it never asks for more than the leftover capacity. (Co-location itself isn't free: our measurements show ~1.8× online p99 even with everything behaving. What escalation guarantees is that batch never takes *more* than the deadline requires.) A batch that's falling behind — because your online traffic spiked and the engine preempted its work — sees its laxity shrink and starts climbing the priority ladder *early*, hours before a wall-clock rule would react, and independently of every other batch. At maximum urgency it sits one notch below online priority with a token-bucket floor guaranteeing forward progress. Deadline math, not hope. And the same arithmetic runs at submission time: a batch whose projected completion already exceeds its window is rejected up front with the numbers in the error — a contract has an admission face, not just a scheduling face.

Two details we got wrong first, so you don't have to:

- **Don't scale urgency by the 24h window.** Our first implementation did, and it quietly turned laxity into wall-clock aging — a perfectly healthy batch at hour 12 escalated to priority ~50 for no reason. Scale by a short escalation *horizon* (6h): urgency stays exactly zero until slack actually gets scarce. An adversarial cross-model code review caught this; the regression test now pins it.
- **Don't panic on ignorance.** A freshly submitted batch has no observed completion rate. Divide by epsilon and it looks infinitely late — instant maximum urgency. Tidal escalates on *evidence* (observed rate) or genuine deadline proximity, never on a missing denominator.

## Two ways to place the policy

Tidal ships both, because we wanted to measure the difference honestly.

**Technique A — the gateway.** A sidecar process owns `/v1/files` + `/v1/batches` (any OpenAI SDK works — point `base_url` at it), stores everything durably in SQLite (Postgres is a DSN swap), and injects batch items into a completely stock vLLM as low-priority requests. It watches the engine's public metrics once a second and adjusts how many batch items are in flight with a TCP-style AIMD loop: back off multiplicatively when online requests queue or KV cache runs hot, probe upward otherwise. Online traffic never touches the gateway — it physically cannot add latency to a request it never sees.

**Technique B — the in-engine scheduler.** `--scheduler-cls tidal.engine.scheduler.TidalScheduler`. A subclass that wraps vLLM's V1 scheduler (wraps — not forks, not reimplements) and fills every iteration's token budget: online first, then batch up to a cap computed from an interference model `T̂(P, C)` that predicts step time from tokens-this-step and resident context. The model calibrates itself from the engine's own step timings — no offline profiling sweep, unlike the research systems — and a KV guardband keeps enough cache headroom that online bursts never wait for memory. When pressure does hit, it evicts the batch request with the least unrecoverable work (prefix-cached tokens survive preemption in vLLM, so "cheapest victim" is measurable).

A, in one sentence: policy outside, works with any recent vLLM, reacts at 1 Hz. B: policy inside, needs the plugin hook, reacts every iteration and harvests slack A can't see. The paper has the head-to-head numbers.

## What it looks like

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --scheduling-policy priority   # your existing server
tidal serve                                                          # the batch tier
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://your-box:8080/v1", api_key="...")
f = client.files.create(file=open("overnight.jsonl", "rb"), purpose="batch")
b = client.batches.create(input_file_id=f.id, endpoint="/v1/chat/completions",
                          completion_window="24h")
# ...come back tomorrow
print(client.files.content(client.batches.retrieve(b.id).output_file_id).text)
```

Crash-safe (items re-queue on restart; vLLM's prefix cache makes re-runs cheap), cancel/expiry semantics identical to OpenAI's (including the weird ones, like partial results surviving cancellation), and a metering ledger that prices batch tokens at 0.5× your online price table — so `tidal report` tells you what your idle capacity earned.

And because the wire format is exactly OpenAI's, existing batch-API clients work unchanged. Our test case is [lazycode](https://github.com/rajagurunath/lazycode), a coding agent that plans work with a realtime model and executes it overnight on batch APIs at the discount — its Tidal adapter is the same ~500 lines as its Anthropic one, and the orchestration layer can't tell the difference.

## What we measured

On our CPU testbed (yes, a MacBook — mechanism validation, not GPU numbers): naive co-location with vLLM's priority field alone destroyed online latency (22.6× p99) while the gateway delivered the same batch work at 1.76×. The A-vs-B comparison produced the night's most interesting result — a placement *inversion*: the in-engine scheduler harvested 71% of the offline throughput ceiling versus the gateway's 45%, but at 8–10× online p99 versus the gateway's ~2×, because on this hardware the binding interference is resident-decode contention, which sits below the reach of admission-time control. External-vs-in-engine isn't a ranking; it's a throughput/latency frontier, and nobody in the fork-based literature has measured it because each system only evaluates its own placement. Full distributions, negative results included, in the paper.

Then we rented actual GPUs — RTX A6000s off the io.net marketplace, Qwen2.5-7B, ≈$7.73 total — and the CPU latency tax mostly evaporated. The gateway harvested **69.3% of that node's own steady-state dedicated-offline ceiling** (1408 output tok/s against an independently probed 2031.5) while online latency went from 0.753s → 0.886s p50 and 1.570s → 1.927s p99: **1.18× / 1.23×** — a cross-node comparison, because we never got a baseline and a co-serving run on the same physical node. On the CPU box the same technique cost 2.54× p50. The diurnal run harvested more — 1607 tok/s, **78.1% of ceiling** — and its per-minute batch completions anti-correlate with online arrivals at **−0.85**, which is the same tide the CPU box shows at −0.95. Technique B on GPU: the compat canary passed on release v0.26.0, but we never got the matrix numbers — our own harness has a direct-submission defect that stalls right after warmup, and it ate the offline-only, naive, and technique-B GPU arms. Roadmap item, not a result.

Those numbers are the corrected ones, and the correction is the more useful story. The first draft of this post said **98.7% of ceiling** and **−0.38** correlation, and built explanations on top of both: co-serving on GPU is nearly free, and the anti-phase is weak because the GPU is so over-provisioned that batch runs near-ceiling in both tides. An independent numerical audit knocked both down. The ceiling was a probe's *whole-burst* average — the probe drains 600 items at concurrency 512 in 18.5 seconds, so half that window is pipeline fill, and the tell was sitting in our own table: the diurnal run "harvested" ~109% of it. **Any co-serving number above 100% of a claimed ceiling means the denominator isn't a ceiling.** Take the last 10 seconds of the probe burst instead and the ceiling is 2031.5 tok/s, not 1426.7 — and the cross-node spread tightens from ±1.4% to ±0.62%, so the corrected instrument is also the better one. The −0.38 was one bin: minute 0 completes 771 batch items against 1667–1894 in every later minute, because the pipeline is still filling while online load is already climbing. Drop it and the correlation is −0.85. The over-provisioning explanation was an artifact talking, and we've deleted it as a conclusion: at 69–78% of steady state there is real headroom being fought over, and the GPU tide behaves like the CPU tide.

Two things we built after that, both smaller experiments with bigger implications. **Fleets**: give the dispatcher two replicas running phase-shifted diurnal load and let placement follow slack, and it harvests **+32%** more batch work than pinning everything to one replica (2494 vs 1884 items), with per-replica anti-correlation of −0.83 and −0.56. That one is back on the small CPU rig — Qwen2.5-0.5B, 1 req/s peak, 16-token completions — so its numbers don't compare to the GPU ones above — it really is timing work into each replica's trough. The honest caveat is that our two "replicas" share a memory bus (macOS can't pin cores, only thread counts), so the fleet arm's blended online latency is worse, not better — 3.41s p50 vs 1.44s. GPU fleets with real isolation are where that resolves; what CPU proves is the mechanism. **Freeze/thaw**: prefill a 1973-token prompt in one process, persist the KV to disk, kill the process, thaw in a fresh one — bit-identical greedy decode, TTFT 7.277s → 0.229s, **31.8×**. (A duplicate arm that thawed from the in-engine prefix cache instead of across a process boundary measured 48.2×; we quote the smaller cross-process number, because surviving process death is the property a deferred prefill actually needs.) Short prompts get much less — 208 tokens gives only 1.9×, since just 128 of them are cached and the fixed per-file read cost dominates — so the "~1k token crossover" is an *interpolation* between two measured points, not something we measured. And it moves FLOPs in time rather than saving any: 23.6 MB of KV for that prompt, which is 1920 cached tokens (only whole 128-token blocks persist) at exactly 12,288 B/token for a 0.5B model — two orders worse for 70B-class — so storage is the binding constraint, and the connector we used is debug-grade with all-or-nothing prompt-hash keying. But it's the thing a deadline buys you that nothing else in the stack can: disaggregation separates prefill from decode in space; a contracted batch tier separates them in time.
